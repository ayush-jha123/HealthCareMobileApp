# 🩺 Medical Recommendation System

A comprehensive **AI-powered medical guidance system** combining a **Flask-based web app** and a **React Native Expo mobile app**. The system uses a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** for symptom-based disease prediction and delivers personalized treatment plans.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

- **Backend:** Python Flask application with a trained SVC model
- **Frontend:** Web UI + React Native mobile app via WebView
- **Functionality:** Accepts user symptoms and outputs diagnosis, medications, diet, exercises, and precautions
- **ML Model:** Trained on 8 datasets with 133 diseases and 400+ symptoms

---

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model:** Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with linear kernel
- **Accuracy:** 100% on validation set
- **Features:** 400+ binary-encoded symptoms
- **Strategy:** One-vs-Rest classification
- **Response Time:** < 500ms per query

```python
svc = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
````

## 🌐 Flask Web Application

### 🔧 Features

* Multi-modal input: text and speech
* Structured output: diagnosis, medication, diet, exercise
* TailwindCSS for clean UI
* 24/7 accessible interface

### ▶️ Setup

```bash
cd backend-flask
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 📱 React Native Mobile App (Expo)

### 📌 Features

* Loads the Flask app via WebView
* Works on both Android and iOS
* Cross-platform via Expo
* Plug-and-play frontend for the Flask backend

### ▶️ Setup

```bash
cd mobile-app-react-native
npm install
npx expo start
```

### ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the Flask URL in `App.js`:

```js
const WEBVIEW_URL = 'http://your-local-ip:5000'; // Replace with your actual server IP
```

Ensure your mobile device is on the same network as your backend server.

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Covers only 133 diseases
* Needs medical validation before clinical deployment
* Speech input accuracy may vary by user accent and noise levels

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Extend database to 300+ diseases and multilingual symptoms
* Implement native input forms in the mobile app
* Add EHR (Electronic Health Record) integration
* Include wearable device support and voice assistant commands
* Enable PWA caching for offline support
